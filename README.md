## Description
Stock Trading Web Application built using the MERN Stack. Currently, it's still in WIP but way past a proof on concept! This is a personal project but uses the same idea of a stock trading web application from a course I did in school. However, all code here was typed from scratch for educational purposes and for fun! Furthermore, this project uses ReactJS and Redux whereas the other project used HBS, a templating engine.

## Deployment
If I were to deploy this on a real production environment, I would simply use AWS and deploy on an EC2 instance and I would most likely upgrade my MongoDB database. If I expect there to be a lot of users i.e. 300+, I would most likely use a relational database like MySQL for scalability.

Please note that Heroku will need to redeploy the application so please be patient!
